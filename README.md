# Democracy Index Analysis – Alternative 1

**A data-driven exploration of global Democracy Index trends and their correlations with key socio-economic indicators, implemented entirely in Python and Jupyter.**

This is the **first alternative** of the Democracy Index project. For the second alternative that integrates **Python, SQL, and Tableau**, see:  
[Alternative 2 – Python + SQL + Tableau](https://github.com/Dan131O/Democracy_Index_Analysis_Alternative2)

## How to View This Project

You can explore the project results at three levels of detail:

1. **Full notebook (source code, visualizations, written analysis):**

   - Open [`main_notebook.ipynb`](./main_notebook.ipynb)

2. **Summary Report (visualizations, written analysis):**

   - Open [`Project_Report.pdf`](./Project_Report.pdf)

3. **Visualizations only:**

   - Browse the [`Output_Visualizations/`](./Output_Visualizations/) folder

## Project Overview

This project evaluates the relationship between the **Economist’s Democracy Index** and several key indicators:

- **Press Freedom Score**
- **Life Expectancy**
- **Education Spending (% of GDP)**
- **Population**

The main goal is to test the hypothesis:

> *Countries with higher democracy scores exhibit better press freedom, longer life expectancy, and higher educational investments.*

## Core Analytical Steps in [`main_notebook.ipynb`](./main_notebook.ipynb)

1. Libraries imported:  
`pandas`  
`numpy`  
`seaborn`  
`matplotlib`  
`scipy`  
`scikit-learn`  
`jupyter`
2. Load & clean datasets (Democracy Index, Press Freedom, Life Expectancy, etc.)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - Plot democracy vs. each indicator
   - Visual examination of correlations
4. Quantitative analysis:
   - Pearson correlation coefficients
   - Linear regression models
   - Metrics: R² score, regression coefficients for each indicator
5. Results exported as plots in [`Output_Visualizations/`](./Output_Visualizations/)
6. Findings summarized in [`Project_Report.pdf`](./Project_Report.pdf)

## Example Insights

- **Democracy vs. Press Freedom:** Positive correlation with Pearson *r* ≈ 0.8
- **Democracy vs. Life Expectancy:** Moderate correlation with *r* ≈ 0.6
- **Democracy vs. Education Spending:** Weaker correlation, *r* ≈ 0.4
- Regression summary table included in PDF report

## Tested Environment

- **Last updated:** Jul 12, 2025
- **Tested with Python versions:** 3.10 – 3.13
- **OS compatibility:** Developed and tested on Windows; should work on Unix/macOS systems as well

## How to Reproduce

### **A) Recommended: Command-Line Method**

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dan131O/Democracy_Index_Analysis_Alternative1.git
cd Democracy_Index_Analysis_Alternative1
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**  
*(You can name the environment folder as you wish; here we use **`venv`** as an example)*

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the analysis notebook**

```bash
jupyter notebook main_notebook.ipynb
```

### **B) Alternative: Run in Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**

1. **Open the project folder in VS Code**
2. **Open the integrated terminal** (`Ctrl + \``)
3. **Create and activate a virtual environment** as above, if not already done
4. **Install dependencies** as above, if not already done
5. **Open [`main_notebook.ipynb`](./main_notebook.ipynb) directly in VS Code**  
   • The [Jupyter extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) lets you view and run cells interactively.
6. **Select the correct Python interpreter** (the venv you just created) from the kernel picker at the top right of the notebook.

**You can also run the notebook in Jupyter Lab, Google Colab, or any compatible environment as desired.**
